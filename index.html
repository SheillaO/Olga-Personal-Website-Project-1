    <h2> Fun facts about me </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I debug React components by day and binge K-dramas by night—turns out both require patience with plot twists
            you didn't see coming.
            My watchlist spans Seoul to Bangkok to Tokyo, and I've learned that Asian dramas and coding have a lot in
            common: slow burns that pay off beautifully, side characters (props) that steal the show, and cliffhangers
            that keep you up until 3 AM muttering "just one more episode" or "just one more bug fix."</li>
        <li>I'm a Nairobi-based developer who dreams of writing a sitcom about tech life in Africa.
            Picture it: "The Bug Report"—a show where product managers promise features "by end of week," developers
            debug during power outages, and everyone communicates in a mix of Sheng, JavaScript, and passive-aggressive
            Slack messages. I'd star in it, but I'm too busy living it. Stand-up comedy is next on my list—nothing
            writes itself like the absurdity of explaining APIs to stakeholders.</li>
        <li> I believe that if K-drama heroines can survive corporate politics AND save the company, I can definitely
            figure out conditional rendering.
            My coding soundtrack? OSTs from "Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha." My debugging mantra? "What would the female lead
            do?" (Answer: persist stubbornly until the problem gives up first.)</li>
